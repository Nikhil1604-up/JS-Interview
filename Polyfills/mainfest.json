# 📄 Azure Device Update – `manifest.json` Explained

## ✅ Overview

In Azure Device Update (ADU), the `manifest.json` file describes the metadata, 
compatibility, and installation instructions for a firmware or software update. 
It plays a critical role in how devices receive and apply updates securely and reliably.

"It's a structured JSON that declares the update's identity, 
compatible devices, update files, and how the device should apply it. 
It ensures only valid devices receive secure and verified updates."

## 📦 Purpose of `manifest.json`

- Identifies the update package uniquely
- Defines which devices the update applies to
- Specifies how the update should be installed
- Lists included files and their checksums for integrity

“SHA-256 is a secure hashing algorithm used to generate a unique fingerprint of a file or string. 
In systems like Azure ADU, it's used to validate file integrity before devices install updates, preventing tampering or corruption.”
